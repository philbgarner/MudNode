# MudNode

MudNode is an experimental MUD system written in NodeJS and played in your browser with WebSockets.

## Installation

You need to have NodeJS installed on your system, then from a command prompt inside the folder you extracted this repository to run `npm install`.

It will automatically download and install any NPM packages required to run MudNode.

## Running MudNode

Once NPM package dependencies are installed, you can run it with `node index.js`.  This will start the server back-end and also serve the front-end client on localhost:8080.  Direct your browser to http://localhost:8080/ and register your username to begin.
